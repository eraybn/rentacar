Program Introduction
First, a database with the same name as the database is opened in our rental automation,
Then the database in our file is imported to the file we opened.
After logging in with the username and password specified in the login panel, we can perform the desired operation.

The XAMPP program is run for connections.
MySql is started.
MySql is found and run from the computer menu and the localhost connection is approved.
